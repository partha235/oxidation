## oxidation
***
* Oxidation ==> lose of electron.
* Reduction ==> gain of electron.
* The term reduction was given due to reduction in oxidation number of an atom.
* The oxidation is referred with the number of electron gained or lose in the formation of chemical compound of an atom.
* If an atom lose an electron for formation of compound then its oxidation number is __+1__.
* If an atom gain an electron for formation of compound then its oxidation number is __-1__.
* Example in the formation of CH<sub>3</sub>, the carbon gain 4 electron from 4 hydrogen atom, then its oxidation number is __-3__. And the remaining 4 hydrogen atom lose 1 electron so their oxidation number is __+1__ for each.
